Goals: Learn about a scientific computing application. Learn about reading input using the StdIn library and printing formatted output using the StdOut library. Learn about plotting graphics using the StdDraw library. Learn about using the command line to redirect standard input to read from a file. Learn to build up complex results using a sequence of simple statements Use nested loops Use arrays.

Background: In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton formulated the principles governing the the motion of two particles under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction in his famous Principia. However, Newton was unable to solve the problem for three particles. Indeed, in general, systems of three or more particles can only be solved numerically. Your challenge is to write a program to simulate the motion of N particles in the plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Scientists also apply the same techniques to other pairwise interactions including Coulombic, Biot-Savart, and van der Waals.
